#Two Stream Instability

Early version of a two-stream instability simulation. Hoping to finish it by sunday and also post to the blog.

The two boxes will show the histogram and potential/ef plot. Also there will be options to change the coloring 
and various parameters. Right now, the coloring is based on "fade away" with increasing velocity.
